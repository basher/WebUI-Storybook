# Icons

## Accessibility considerations

- Accessible HTML markup for icons is based on [these](https://www.24a11y.com/2018/accessible-svg-icons-with-inline-sprites/) [three](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/accessible-icon-buttons/) [articles](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/05/22/contextual-images-svgs-and-a11y.html).
- The `<title>` element in decorative icons and icon-only buttons provides additional textual context on mouse `:hover`.
- Ensure `<title>` and/or `<span class="sr-only">` convey the correct meaning of the icon button or link.
- However, if the icon is purely decorative and there is visible text associated with it, there is no need for `<title>` attribute, and the `role="img"` should be replaced with `aria-hidden="true"`.

## Using external SVG sprites with `<use href=""/>"`

- The sprites (for each UI theme) need to be manually copied from the `static\[theme-name]` folder in `WebUI repo` to the `public` folder in this repo in order to be available.
- We cannot reference the sprites directly from the WebUI Parcel server `http://localhost:1234` due to CORS errors.

## Icon sizes

- The default icon size is `1em` so that it inherits the font size of its parent container.
- Selecting any of the available size variants will set a specific icon size in `rem` units.

## SVG sprite theming
- `.storybook\preview-head.html` contains a config object:
```
KBconfig = {
    theme: 'whitelabel',
}
```
- Change the theme to `theme1`, for example, to view the correct icon set.
- Storybook will need to be **stopped & restarted** for this change to take effect.
