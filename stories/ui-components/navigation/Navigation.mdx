# Site navigation

## Accessibility & responsive considerations
- Keyboard users are prevented from accidentally triggering the dropdown sub-navigation, to minimise the number of keystrokes required to navigate the website.
    - All the top-level navigation links therefore **must go to real pages**, which should themselves contain links to any other pages that would have been in the dropdown.
- The **same HTML** is used for mobile, tablet and larger screen layouts.
    - Please note that the navigation HTML is nested inside `<header>` to enable JavaScript behaviour (e.g. triggering overlays).

## Testing navigation
- To properly test functionality (e.g. responsive and touch behaviour):
    - Click the `'Open canvas in new tab'` button in the Storybook `Canvas mode` toolbar.
    - Then use browser dev tools responsive emulator.

## Viewing the underlying HTML code
- The code in the navigation preview below has been simplified in order to see the overall structure of the navigation component.
    - Sub-components such as links, buttons, and dropdown content have been written as JavaScript `template literals` fragments, and therefore the `show code` button cannot fully expand the rendered HTML.
    - These sub-components are rendered in the `Site navigation sub-components` folder.
- There are inline `<style>` blocks to allow the navigation & fragments to render correctly in the Storybook preview pane.

## TODO
- Fix `is-hoisted` class to use correct BEM syntax - i.e. `ui-navigation__item--is-hoisted`.
