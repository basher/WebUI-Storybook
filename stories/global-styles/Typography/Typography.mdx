# Fluid responsive typography

- We're implementing [simplified fluid typography](https://css-tricks.com/simplified-fluid-typography/) by leveraging [CSS clamp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp).
- We have Sass `fluid-type-` mixins that define the **minimum**, **maximum** and **ideal** font sizes for specific elements, and fallbacks for unsupported browsers. For example:
```
body { @include fluid-type-default; }
h1 { @include fluid-type-xxl; }
```
- This enables us to achieve nice responsive results with
    - minimal usage of `font-size` declarations,
    - usage of `unset` and `inherit` values,
    - very few, if any, media queries.
- RTL languages are supported too.
    - The `root` font size is increased to improve legibility of these languages
    - The `fluid-type-` mixins increase the font-sizes by the same scaling factor.

## Displaying current theme typefaces
- Please refer to the [Colours story](/?path=/docs/global-styles-colours--colours) for an explanation of how we dynamically import the theme colours. The same strategy is used for importing the theme typefaces.
