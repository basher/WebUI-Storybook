# Quick view item
- This is a composite component made up of [Asymmetric grid](/story/ui-components-layouts-grid--grid-asymmetric), [Responsive video](/story/ui-components-responsive-media--responsive-video), [Stock toolbar](/story/ui-components-toolbar-stock-toolbar--toolbar-stock), [Product summary](/story/ui-components-product-product-summary--product-summary) and [Product specs (subset)](/story/ui-components-product-product-specs--product-specs) components.

## Accessibility considerations
- Some of the HTML markup from these components has been removed (e.g. `<section>` tags) to simplify the overall DOM.

## Quick view product card grid
- If quick view is enabled in the back-end, the product cards will have quick view open/close buttons enabled, which Ajax fetch quick view HTML fragments.

## Accessibility considerations
- The open/close buttons will have `aria-expanded` attributes, as they behave like "toggle" buttons.
