# Responsive tables

## Accessibility & responsive considerations
- Placing a table inside an overflowing container [as per these guidelines](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/11/under-engineered-responsive-tables.html?ref=sidebar) is the simplest way to achieve a fully accessible & responsive table, which is keyboard & screen reader friendly.
- The container has an `aria-labelledby` attribute pointing to a unique ID on the table `<caption>`.

## TODO:
- How configurable is WYSIWYG editor in CMS?
- Do we need JavaScript to auto-generate unique IDs?
- Is overflow container an acceptable responsive solution, or do we need to present a linear view?
    - Using only CSS to change table display properties breaks table semantics in assistive technologies.
    - We would need JavaScript to add appropriate `ARIA` roles too.
