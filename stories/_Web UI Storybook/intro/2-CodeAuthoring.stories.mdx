# Code authoring guidelines & accessibility

- All UI components are authored with **semantic HTML5** markup, which is **progressively enhanced** with `WAI-ARIA` and `JavaScript` as appropriate.
    - Some JavaScript-driven components also add an `is-js-enabled` class to the component's parent container, allowing different CSS behaviour to be applied.
- The [WebUI repo](https://github.com/basher/WebUI-Parcel) that bundles all the static UI assets for this Storybook contains a `README` which explains:
    - JavaScript and CSS architecture.
    - Progressive enhancement, and **"no JavaScript"** behaviour.
    - CSS namespacing with `BEM` conventions and `ui-` prefixes.
