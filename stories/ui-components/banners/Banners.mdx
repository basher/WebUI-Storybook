# Banners

## Responsive and performance considerations
- Please refer to the [Responsive images story](/story/ui-components-images--responsive-image) or [Fixed size images story](/story/ui-components-images--fixed-size-image) for `<img>` HTML markup, etc.
- Please refer to the [Sliders story](/story/ui-components-slider-or-carousel--slider) for slider considerations.

## Hero banner with overlay
- Hero banners tend to be on homepages, but can be used anywhere.
- Overlay is hidden on mobile, and is shown below the banner image instead.
- Overlay position is based on a `3x3 grid`, where the `vertical` position is specified first, followed by the `horizontal`:

```
| top-left      | top-middle    | top-right    |
| middle-left   | middle-middle | middle-right |
| bottom-left   | bottom-middle | bottom-right |
```

## Hero banners in slider
- The slider component has an additional `data-slide-variable-height="true"` attribute to alter the default slider behaviour (e.g. button positioning is based on the banner image height, not the overall slide height).
- The slider also has a CSS `ui-slider--banner` class to identify it specifically as a banner slider.

## Banner with clickable overlay
- Overlay position controls make no difference to clickable overlay position.
