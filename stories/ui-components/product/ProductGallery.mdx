# Product gallery
- For simplicity, this story does not demonstrate opening the gallery in a modal lightbox.
- Please refer to the [gallery modal story](/story/ui-components-gallery-gallery1--gallery-1-modal) for this behaviour and complete HTML markup, etc.

## TODO: Replace gallery with alternate layout?
- See [gallery1 alternate layout story](/story/ui-components-gallery-gallery1--gallery-1-alternate).
