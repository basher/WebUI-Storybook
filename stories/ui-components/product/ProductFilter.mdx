# Product filter
- Used in site navigation.
- Product filters are displayed as tabs by `ui-tabs` class.
- Product filter cards are laid out in a grid by `ui-grid` class.
- Each product filter card is a simplification of the [product card](/story/ui-components-cards-product--product-card) component, but marked up with an HTML5 block `<a>`.
