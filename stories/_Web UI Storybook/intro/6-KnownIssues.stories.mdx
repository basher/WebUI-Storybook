# Known Storybook issues
- Component JS doesn't fire in `docs` mode. But that's OK, as it shows what is rendered if JS were to be disabled.
- Storybook fires `DOMContentLoaded` event [more than once](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/15753). We fire a `custom Storybook event` in `.storybook\preview-head.html` which is listened for in `index.ts` (inside the Parcel repo) in order to re-initialise the JS.

## Known Parcel V2 issues
- [Legacy browser issue](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/6676). This means that legacy browsers will **NOT** work in local .Net Dev environment.
