# Branch locator map with contact card overly
- A hardcoded Google map is shown, as we're not linking to the 3rd party map service in Storybook.
- The standard card HTML markup has been simplified for the contact card overlay - i.e. there's no need for card to be an `<article>` with a proper heading.
