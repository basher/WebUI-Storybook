# CSS utility classes

CSS utility classes can be found in the `.\src\scss\globals\_utilities.scss` Sass partial in our `WebUI repo`.

Class | Functionality
--- | ---
`sr-only` | Visually hide the content but still available for screen readers.
`is-hidden` | Hide at all breakpoints.
`is-hidden-on-small` | Hide at small breakpoint.
`is-hidden-on-medium` | Hide at medium breakpoint.
`is-hidden-on-large` | Hide at large breakpoint.
`is-js-enabled` | Added by JavaScript to specific components, allowing custom overrides of default CSS behaviour.
`has-open-modal` | Hides overflow (e.g. on `<body>`) when modal or any full-page overlay is open.
`has-scroll-margin` | Adds CSS `scroll-margin` so content is not hidden below sticky header.
`is-disabled` | Applies same styling as `:disabled` elements (e.g. to a form field that has a disabled input inside it).
