# Product (stock) search results
- The basic functionality (e.g. filtering) works without JavaScript, but is progressively enhanced.
    - All filtering is still performed server-side.
    - The filters are loaded into a modal.
    - Please refer to the [Modal story](/story/ui-components-modal--modal-ajax) for modal considerations, and specifically fetching content via Ajax.
- The `RESET` button behaves as a normal `<button type="reset">` without JavaScript.
    - It is then progressivley enhanced to remove all filtering options (i.e. the `URL parameters`) via the `data-reset-url` attribute.
    - The page is reloaded without these URL parameters.

## TODO
- Rename components to `stock`?
- Apply Ajax filtering?
