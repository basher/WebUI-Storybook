# Page layout
- Page layout is defined by `semantic HTML5 landmark regions` & other appropriate structural elements.
- `<div class="kb-layout">` is a `CSS Flex` container, with `flex-direction: column;`.
- `<main>` element has `flex-grow: 1;` to ensure the footer & sticky footer are pushed all the way down.

## Layout modifiers:

CSS classname | Use in CMS | Functionality
--- | --- | ---
`kb-layout__inner` | NO | Internal wrapper. Acts as an additional styling hook (e.g. if `<header>` or `<footer>` are 100% wide, but internal content needs constraining).
`kb-layout__fullbleed` | YES | Creates full-bleed container (e.g. for banners) that extends 100% of browser viewport, irrespective of any *bleed* areas.
`kb-layout__has-max-width` | YES | Creates a container whose `max-width` is capped, based on the value of the `--themeMaxContentWidth` CSS variable.
`kb-layout__has-no-max-width` | YES | Creates a container whose width is not constrained, but takes up **100% of available space**.
`NULL` | YES | i.e. **No** CSS classname needed. Also creates a container whose width is not constrained, but takes up **100% of available space**.
`kb-layout__has-centered-content` | YES | Also creates a container whose width is not constrained, but whose **content is centered**.
