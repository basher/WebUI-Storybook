# Video player
- This component intercepts embedded videos (e.g. YouTube) and loads the video into a modal.
    - This prevents YouTube from downloading all its JavaScript code until a user has hit the play button.
- There's a static placeholder image, with a custom play button.

## Copy/paste the correct bits of HTML
- To use this component, simply copy/paste this fragment of the HTML from the snippet:
```
<div class="ui-video-player">
    ...
</div>
```

- Update the following HTML attributes on the respective elements in the snippet:

HTML element | Attribute | Functionality
--- | --- | ---
`<a>` |`href` | Replace the link's `href` attribute with the text inside the video `src` attribute from YouTube embed code.
`<a>` | `data-video-height` | Height of video (if available in the YouTube embed code). If left blank, the theme CSS will ensure the video displays with an appropriate aspect ratio.
`<a>` | `data-video-width` | As above.
`<img>` | `alt` | Replace the `alt` text with appropriate text. This will provide meaningful text for the `<a>` as well as a title for the video.
`<img>` | `src` | Replace the `src` text with the correct URL of the placeholder image.

## Accessibility considerations
- The modal behaviour is as per our default modals (e.g. image gallery).
- There is NO explicit heading in the modal, as the video itself should have an accessible `title` provided.
