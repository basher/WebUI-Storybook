# Tabs
- The `ui-tabs__title` can be any appropriate heading level, not just an `<h2>`.

## Responsive behaviour & accessibility considerations
- [Stacking tabs vertically on narrow viewports](https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/#responsivedesign) is usually the simplest and best solution.
    - However, we are actually **converting tabs to accordions** when **tab container width is less than the specified minimum value** in the JavaScript `constructor` method for this component.
    - We are **not** converting accordions back to tabs... a page reload is required for this.
- Tabs are fully keyboard accessible:
    - Use `TAB | SHIFT TAB` key to focus on currently selected tab, and traverse the content inside the tab.
    - Use `RIGHT | DOWN` arrow key to focus on next tab.
    - Use `LEFT | UP` arrow key to focus on previous tab.
    - Use `HOME | END` key to focus on first or last tab.

## Do NOT convert tabs to accordion:
- When the tabs container has a `data-tabs-no-accordion="true"` attribute.
