# Default card
- Default card component is marked up as an `<article>` and should therefore contain a heading with the appropriate level.
- The media, marked up as a `<figure>`, can contain `<img>`, `<video>`, `<iframe>`, etc.

# Quiet card
- Quiet cards have no visual treatment such as background colour, border, shadow, etc.
- In some themes, they may look exactly like default cards.

## Fullwidth default card
- This is an example of a fullwidth card component, allowing images (or any media) to sit alongside content, but without width constraints on the card itself.
- It also demonstrates using a fully responsive image, with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes. See [Responsive images story](/story/ui-components-images--responsive-image).

## Default cards in a grid - responsive behaviour
- It's probably best to only use **vertical** cards inside a grid, as there's no way of determining how much horizonatal space is available in each card without using JavaScript.
- The grid container has an extra `ui-card-grid` class to override the default CSS Grid behaviour of `ui-grid`. See [Grid layout story](/story/ui-components-layouts-grid--grid).
- For example, the `ui-card-grid` column min-widths are overridden by:
```
.ui-card-grid.ui-grid { @include responsive-grid-columns($min-width: 17.5rem) }
```
