# Publishing Storybook to Chromatic

## When should this be done?
- If Storybook is updated, follow the procedure below for **ALL UI themes**, completing the whole procedure for each theme in turn.
- If a specific theme UI is updated, follow the procedure below for **specific UI theme only**.

## 1. Ensure Parcel UI and Storybook repos are up-to-date
- Checkout and pull latest code in `master` branch for both repos.
- Empty the following `dist` folders in each repo:
    - Parcel UI: `WebUI/dist/`
    - Storybook: `WebUIStorybook/public/dist/`
- If the `dist` folders don't exist, create them first as they are not stored in Git.

## 2. Build Parcel UI (per theme) and copy to Storybook repo
- Use the following script to build Parcel UI assets for 1 theme at a time.
```
npm run build:theme-storybook --web-ui-parcel:theme=[theme-name]
```
- Copy these 2 JSON files from `WebUI/dist/` into `WebUI/dist/theme-build` folder:
    - `exported-colors.json`
    - `exported-typography.json`
- Copy all the files from `WebUI/dist/theme-build` folder to `WebUIStorybook/public/dist/` folder.

> NOTE: If you get errors running the build command from VSCode, try running it from an external terminal window (e.g. Git Bash).

## 3. Get Chromatic project token
- This is a **one time** operation per Chromatic project (i.e. theme).
- See screenshot below for locating the Chromatic token for each project:
![Chromatic manage](chromatic-manage.jpg)
- For each project, add a Chromatic script to `package.json` in Storybook repo, with correct project token:
```
"scripts": {
    "chromatic:whitelabel": "npx chromatic --project-token=813c271a0864"
}
```

## 4. Publish Storybook to Chromatic
- Finally, build Chromatic for each project in turn. For example:
```
npm run chromatic:whitelabel
```
- This runs the `build-storybook` NPM script.
