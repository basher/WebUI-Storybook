# Swatch
- This is a custom `slider` with specific `data-slide-` attributes to trigger certain behaviours.
- The `tab controls` are created from swatch thumbnails, which each have a `data-slide-tab="true"` attribute.
- The slider also has an `<h2>` rather than an `aria-label`.

## TODO:
- Add the `data-slide-tab="true"` attribute directly to the thumb `<img>` when we can add that markup in back-code image helper.
