# Viewing & testing components

## Reversing text direction - e.g. `dir="rtl"`

- Edit the `<html>` tag inside Storybook's `<div id="root">` via browser dev tools.

## Viewing live component changes

- Any story changes via `controls` addon will automatically refresh the UI.
- You can also view the story in a new browser window or in full screen mode (without all the Storybook UI and toolbars):
    - Click the `'Open canvas in new tab'` or `'Go full screen'` buttons in the Storybook `Canvas mode` toolbar.

## Responsive view (and touch device) emulation

- Storybook does have a responsive view addon, but this is not as good as the browser's own responsive viewport emulation in dev tools.
