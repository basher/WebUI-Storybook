# Flex
- Uses `CSS Flexbox` to provide some simple layout solutions.

## Default behaviour & overrides
- The flex properties below have either been explicitly set in the Sass, or have been omitted to ensure browser defaults are used:

Property | Functionality
--- | ---
`flex-wrap: wrap` | Explicitly set. Overrides the default `flex-wrap: nowrap` so flex items will naturally wrap rather than cause an overflow.
`flex: 0 1 auto` | Browser default is used. `flex-grow` is 0, so items will not grow larger than their `flex-basis` size. `flex-shrink` is 1, so items can shrink rather than overflow. `flex-basis` is auto, so items will be sized based on their content.

- The story `controls` below add additional CSS classes to override the default `ui-flex` component behaviour detailed above:

Control | Functionality
--- | ---
`direction` | Overrides the default `flex-direction: row` property.
`justification` | Overrides the default `justify-content: flex-start` property.
`alignment` | Overrides the default `align-items: stretch` property.

## Flex layout using `<div>` elements

## Flex layout using `<ul><li>` elements
- Use semantic `<ul><li>` if it makes sense to have a **list of related "things"** rendered in a flexbox container.
