# Gallery 1
- Please refer to the [Layouts - Grid story](/story/ui-components-layouts-grid--grid) for `CSS Grid` HTML markup, etc.
- Please refer to the [Images story](/story/ui-components-images--responsive-image) for `<img>` HTML markup, etc.

## TODO
- Decide whether images need captions. They're not currently provided in back-end code.

## Gallery 1 (default thumbnail grid layout)
- This is a **thumbnail** gallery, where clicking on an image will load the **full-size** image in a new browser tab.
- Image `<figcaption>` is revealed on `:hover` or `:focus`.
- The `ui-gallery` class is added to the parent `ui-grid` to enable overriding of default grid behaviour. For example, setting the grid columns to `auto-fill` so that they don't expand beyond the maximum size of the images.

## Gallery 1 (alternate thumbnail grid layouts)
- The `ui-gallery--layout-thumbs-` modifier classes allow alternate layouts comprising **2 or 3 thumbnails per row** which, when combined together, produce a masonry-type layout.
- We are no longer using semantic `<ul><li>` constructs for these alternate gallery layouts, as each row of the gallery is actually a separate grid container, so it makes no sense to announce these as separate lists.

### TODO: Re-organise gallery stories?
- Add click behaviour to this gallery to launch modal lightbox.
- For now, please see [Gallery modal story](/story/ui-components-gallery-gallery1--gallery-1-modal) for example of clicking an image to load bigger image in a modal lightbox.

## Gallery 1 (thumbnails in tabs)
- The `ui-gallery__tabs` class is added to the parent `ui-tabs` to enable overriding of default tabs behaviour.
- `data-tabs-no-accordion="true"` ensures that the gallery tabs are not converted to an accordion on smaller screens.
- Ensure an appropriate heading level is used for the `ui-tabs__title` headings.

##  Gallery 1 (full-size images in slider)
- Please refer to the [Sliders story](/story/ui-components-slider-or-carousel--slider) for slider considerations.
- The slider contains **full-size** images, not thumbnails.
- The number of slides, or their widths, can be modified using the `data-slide-count` and `data-slide-width` attributes.
- The `ui-gallery` class is added to the parent `ui-slider` to enable overriding of default slider behaviour.

## Gallery 1 (slider in modal lightbox )
- Please refer to the [Modal story](/story/ui-components-modal--modal-ajax) for modal considerations, and specifically fetching content via Ajax.
- Clicking on an image thumbnail will load the corresponding **full-size** image in a modal lightbox slider.
    - These thumbnail links have additional `data-` attributes to trigger this behaviour.
- The slider has additional `data-` attributes to identify it as the target slider, and to hide it until the modal is opened.
- The slider has an `<h2>`, rather than the default slider `aria-label`, which is referenced by the modal `aria-labelledby`.
- The slide widths should all be 100% in the modal.
- The `ui-gallery__modal` class is added to the parent `ui-modal__overlay` to enable overriding of default modal behaviour.
